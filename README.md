## Technical Details

### Battery Health Optimization

This extension promotes good battery health practices:
- **40% Low Threshold**: Prevents deep discharge cycles that can damage lithium-ion batteries
- **80% High Threshold**: Avoids keeping batteries at 100% charge, which can reduce long-term capacity

### Performance

- **Lightweight**: Minimal system resource usage
- **Efficient Polling**: 30-second check intervals balance responsiveness with battery life
- **Non-blocking**: Uses GLib timeouts for asynchronous operation

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. Check if the extension is enabled:
   ```bash
   gnome-extensions list --enabled | grep batteryind
   ```

2. Check for errors in the logs:
   ```bash
   journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell
   ```

3. Restart GNOME Shell:
   ```bash
   # On X11
   killall -3 gnome-shell
   
   # On Wayland (requires logout/login)
   gnome-session-quit --logout
   ```

### Notifications Not Appearing

1. Ensure notifications are enabled in GNOME Settings:
   - Open Settings ‚Üí Notifications
   - Make sure notifications are enabled

2. Check if the extension icon shows notifications are enabled (green icon)

3. Test with battery levels in the trigger ranges (< 40% or ‚â• 80%)
